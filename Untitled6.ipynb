        "Humans are surrounded by a complex world full of information. How do humans survive without being overwhelmed? There are often hundreds to thousands of objects and other kinds of information within view, but our sensory and cognitive capacities are limited. Fortunately, not all objects or information matters for our current agenda or long-term goal of survival. Through evolution and learning, humans have gradually developed strategies for selecting information. This is referred to as selective attention. As artificial intelligence (AI) migrates from a simple digital world to the complex real world, the same challenge awaits AI agents: How do they select important information from a world full of information? A given computational model, either biological or digital, has limited capacity. Therefore attentional selection is necessary to ensure that resources are devoted to the key components. Because humans actively seek the information they need, gaze can reveal the underlying attentional patterns [Posner and Petersen, 1990]. Humans have high acuity foveal vision in the central 1-2 visual degrees of the visual field (i.e., covering the width of a finger at arm’s length), with resolution decreasing in the periphery. They have learned to move their foveae to the correct place at the right time to process important task-relevant visual stimuli [Borji and Itti, 2014; Hayhoe, 2017]. This type of selective attentional mechanism ∗Contact Author developed through evolution and is refined in a lifelong learning process. Given the amount of training data required during this process, it may be easier for AI agents to learn attention directly from human gaze data. Fortunately, human gaze is one of the most cost-efficient types of physiological data that can be collected in large quantities, as a result of progress in eye-tracking hardware and software. The vision science research community has a long history of studying human gaze behaviors; hence, such behaviors are relatively well understood. Because of these reasons, training AI agents using human gaze has become a viable approach. Another concern of using human gaze in AI research arises as artificial agents and robots become more prevalent in human society—the importance of making AI agents understand human intentions and goals cannot be overestimated. In many scenarios, AI agents need to gather information about their human fellows to facilitate mutual understanding and coordination. Primates’ social gaze conveys information about their dispositions, intentions, beliefs, emotions, and other cognitive and emotional states [Emery, 2000]. The ability to perceive gaze is critical in learning and social interactions [Emery, 2000]. We have briefly discussed two reasons to include human gaze in AI research, including (1) AI must develop an attention mechanism to cope with the information-rich world and this mechanism can be learned from human gaze data, and (2) AI agents need to perceive and understand human gaze to better interact with humans. Motivated by these reasons, multiple fields of AI, including computer vision, natural language processing, imitation and reinforcement learning, as well as robotics, have started the effort of building human gaze-assisted AI agents. Many state-of-the-art results can only be achieved with human gaze information, especially in realistic complex task domains. In this survey, we review relevant studies in these four research areas that work towards this common goal in the past five years. We further provide a brief overview of modern eye-tracking software technologies that allow for more accurate and accessible tracking results.\n",
